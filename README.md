# blender-addon

A blender addon used to export several things from Blender to CV. Mainly used for rides (splines) since CV2, later also used for trackless rides and multi-bone hierarchied advanced animations

Btw, the onride pictures are just plain Blender scenes rendered by commandline using a web API, so that's not included here
